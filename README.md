# Baja Fresh Responsive Email

There's a Baja Fresh about two miles from my place and I just love it. I've never signed up for emails from restaurants, but I had the thought of creating a responsive email for the chain, so I went for it.

I researched the brand and made sure that the corporate colors were correct via Chrome Inspect. Google Fonts was instrumental in selecting the two fonts for the tagline and the body copy. All in all, the email was pretty straight forward.
